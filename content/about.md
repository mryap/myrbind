This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. 

The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).

### The Stack
Hosted on GitHub and deploy with Netlify. 

If you regularly use [RMarkdown](https://myrbind.netlify.com/2015/07/23/hello-r-markdown/) for your data analysis, blogdown is the perfect option for building your blog.
